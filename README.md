# Spaceship CRUD Challenge

## Requirements

- Java 21

## About

This repository presents a challenge aimed at creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for spaceships. The goal is to provide a simple yet functional system for managing spaceships.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have Java 21 installed on your system.
3. Run the application.
   
## Security

The API implements a JWT (JSON Web Token) based security system. To access protected endpoints, you'll need to provide a valid JWT token. For testing purposes, you can use the following credentials:

- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: q1w2e3r4

## Endpoints

For more detailed documentation on each endpoint and how to use them, refer to the Swagger UI documentation available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html.

## Integration Tests

The repository includes integration tests for both controllers within the REST API. These tests ensure that the endpoints behave as expected and provide coverage for key functionalities of the application.
